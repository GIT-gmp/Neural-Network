# Neural-Network
Neural networks are a set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the human brain. When you open your eyes, the information you perceive, known as data, is processed by neurons, which are the data processing cells in your brain. These neurons recognize patterns in the data and enable you to identify and understand your surroundings.
